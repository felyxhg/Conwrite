  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>This app is developed and operated by <strong>Felix Haag</strong>. Only the data necessary for the operation of the app is processed. The developer has no access to any personal user content.</p>

  <h2>Data Processing</h2>
  <p>The app <em>Conwrite</em> allows users to create personal handwriting styles and handwritten documents. All handwriting data and documents are stored locally on the user’s device by default. When the optional Pro subscription is activated, data can be synchronized via Apple’s iCloud service to enable access across devices. The synchronization is handled entirely by Apple; the developer has no technical access to any of this data.</p>

  <h2>Analytics and Usage Data</h2>
  <p>No analytics, tracking, or profiling tools are integrated into the app. Only anonymized and aggregated usage statistics provided by Apple through App Store Connect are accessible to the developer (for example, number of installations or crash reports). These do not contain any personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
  <p>Subscriptions and in-app purchases are managed by <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RevenueCat</a>. RevenueCat processes anonymized transaction data, such as purchase date and subscription status, to verify active Pro access. No personal user data (such as names, email addresses, or payment details) is shared with the developer.</p>

  <h2>Legal Basis</h2>
  <p>The processing of data is based on Article 6 (1) (b) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (performance of a contract) and Article 6 (1) (f) GDPR (legitimate interest in providing a secure and functional app).</p>
